# Exploring Simple and Main Effects of Age and Gender on Systemic Differences Using R  

This R script is designed for a comprehensive analysis of the 'Daxguard' dataset, focusing on the relationship between systemic differences (Sysdiff), age, and gender. The script starts by loading and preparing the data, converting gender into a factor for statistical processing. It performs multiple linear regression analyses: a combined analysis for both genders, and separate analyses for males and females. Additionally, it includes an ANCOVA plot to visually compare the effects of age on systemic differences by gender. The script further explores the specific effects of age and gender through a series of calculated predictions, such as the simple effects of age within males and the main effect of age across genders. This detailed analysis helps in understanding how systemic differences are influenced by age and gender in the 'Daxguard' dataset, providing valuable insights into the data's underlying patterns.
